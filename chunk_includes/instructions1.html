BEFORE THE PAGE CONTENT
You might want to cache the images you are using in the experiment
if timings are going to be recorded during the experiment.
Below is an example of how to load an image without showing it.

<div style="display:none">
  <!-- List images here in the same syntax -->
  <!-- <img src = "___image src____" /> -->

<h2><strong>INSTRUCTIONS</strong></h2>
<p>In this experiment, you will listen to sentences and then answer questions about what you heard.</p>
<h3><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>The context of the sentences: Children playing with toy animals!</strong></span></h3>
<p>Each sentence will describe something that a child is acting out with a toy animal. For example, you may hear, <em>"Jane loves to make pastries with the moose!"</em> In this sentence, you could imagine Jane making fake treats with her moose stuffed animal.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Another example: <em>"The cat really likes pizza for breakfast."</em> We may ask you a question like...</p>
<table>
<tbody>
<tr>
<td><strong>Q:&nbsp;</strong>Who really likes pizza for breakfast?</td>
<td><strong>&nbsp;A:</strong> The cat!&nbsp;</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><strong>Q:</strong> What does the cat really like?</td>
<td><strong>&nbsp;A:</strong> Pizza for breakfast!&nbsp;</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><strong>Q:</strong> What does the cat like for breakfast?</td>
<td><strong>&nbsp;A:</strong> Pizza!&nbsp;</td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>
<p>After listening to the sentence, you will hit continue to go to the question screen. You will have <strong>as much time as needed</strong> to fully read the question and provide your answer. Simply type your answer into the input box and then hit 'Enter'.&nbsp;</p>
<h3 ><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>The fun part: You will hear both fast and slow sentences!&nbsp;</strong></span></h3>
<div>
<p>The interesting part of this study is that some of the sentences will be played to you at&nbsp;<strong>double the speed</strong>! <br /> It will sound like listening to an audiobook or a video at 2 times the original rate.&nbsp;</p>
<p>You will hear practice sentences in order to get used to the faster speeds.&nbsp;</p>
</div>
<div>
<p><strong>Instruction Comprehesion Questions:&nbsp;</strong><br /><em>1. Will the sentences involve actual animals or toy animals that children are playing with?</em><br /><input class="obligatory" name="question1" type="radio" value="left" /><label for="q1left"> Actual animals!</label>&nbsp;<input name="question1" type="radio" value="right" /><label for="q1right">&nbsp;The animals are actually child toys!&nbsp;</label></p>
<p><em>2. Do you have a set time period to answer the question?</em><br /><input class="obligatory" name="question2" type="radio" value="left" /><label for="q2left"> Yes</label> <input name="question2" type="radio" value="right" /><label for="q2right">No</label></p>
<p>3<em>. Will the sentences be played at normal speeds, faster speeds, or at both speeds?</em><br /><input class="obligatory" name="question3" type="radio" value="left" /> Only fast speeds <input name="question3" type="radio" value="right" /> A mix of both speeds</p>
